                Proteomic changes in Alzheimer disease 
                associated with progressive Aβ plaque and 
                tau tangle pathologies

                Proteomics can shed light on the dynamic and multifaceted alterations 
                in neurodegenerative disorders like Alzheimer disease (AD). Combining 
                radioligands measuring β-amyloid (Aβ) plaques and tau tangles with 
                cerebrospinal fuid proteomics, we uncover molecular events mirroring 
                diferent stages of AD pathology in living humans. We found 127 diferentially 
                abundant proteins (DAPs) across the AD spectrum. The strongest Aβ-related 
                proteins were mainly expressed in glial cells and included SMOC1 and ITGAM. 
                A dozen proteins linked to ATP metabolism and preferentially expressed 
                in neurons were independently associated with tau tangle load and tau 
                accumulation. Only 20% of the DAPs were also altered in other neurodegenerative diseases, underscoring AD’s distinct proteome. Two co-expression 
                modules related, respectively, to protein metabolism and microglial immune 
                response encompassed most DAPs, with opposing, staggered trajectories 
                along the AD continuum. We unveil protein signatures associated with Aβ and 
                tau proteinopathy in vivo, ofering insights into complex neural responses 
                and potential biomarkers and therapeutics targeting diferent disease stages.
